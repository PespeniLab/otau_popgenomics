# Onthophagus taurus population transcriptomics study

This repository holds scripts for the data processing and analysis for the Onthophagus taurus three population common garden transcriptomics experiment. 

One native (Italy, IT) and two exotic (Western Australia, WA and Eastern US, North Carolina, NC) were kept in common garden conditions for three generations. 
RNA was extracted and sequenced for each of three individuals from each of four developmental stages and both sexes, resulting in 72 individuals sampled.
